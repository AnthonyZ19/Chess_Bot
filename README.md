This is my attempt at making an AI capable of playing chess modeled after alpha zero.

The chess_config.py file contains the functions that create the rules and will allow for the game of chess to be played.
So far uncomplete, I plan to impemement a way for human users to play against the model so far chess notation is supported but it hasn't been fully tested.
I will try to fix any bugs found as soon as possible.
